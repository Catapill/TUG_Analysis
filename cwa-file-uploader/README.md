React based environment

Upon starting (npm start) it creates a web page with a button in which you can chose .cwa file
Chosing .cwa file sends node server a request to post in postgreSQL database instantly

TODO:
Ideally would change the request instead of hardcoding it to making an instance which would send it
And changing how chose button works that it does not instantly send POST request but adds a submit button
which would do the the request
